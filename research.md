**Abstract**: This paper provides evidence that the Mexican interbank market is tiered. I fit the core-periphery model developed by Craig and von Peter (2010) to 157 daily networks (from January 3 to August 15, 2011) of bilateral exposures (aggregated and disaggregated) between 41 commercial banks and 6 development banks. The main findings are (i) the core-periphery model provides a better fit to the Mexican interbank market than random networks, that is there are money center banks that intermediate with the rest of the banks in the market, (ii) the size and the composition of this group of banks is remarkably stable over time for aggregated (and some disaggregated) networks, (iii) the relations (borrowing and lending) between banks in the core and the periphery are asymmetric. The results are robust and significant.

‣ Stock returns in Mexico are associated with macroeconomic surprises of Mexico *and* the U.S.

**Abstract**: This paper studies the relationship between the arrival of macroeconomic news and the Mexican stock market. We examine the reaction of daily excess returns of the stock price index, and seven sector portfolios, to macroeconomic news from Mexico and the U.S. We use GARCH models and focus on the unexpected component of the news from 2003 to 2008. We find that the dynamics of daily returns in the Mexican stock market is linked to the arrival of new information (surprises) on macroeconomic fundamentals of both Mexico and the U.S.

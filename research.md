[Impact of Macroeconomic News from Mexico and the U.S. on the Mexican Stock Market](http://www.economiamexicana.cide.edu/num_anteriores/XXI-1/02_EM_Impacto%20de%20sorpresas(35-67).pdf)

‣ Stock returns in Mexico are associated with macroeconomic surprises of Mexico *and* the U.S.

*Abstract*: This paper studies the relationship between the arrival of macroeconomic news and the Mexican stock market. We examine the reaction of daily excess returns of the stock price index, and seven sector portfolios, to macroeconomic news from Mexico and the U.S. We use GARCH models and focus on the unexpected component of the news from 2003 to 2008. We find that the dynamics of daily returns in the Mexican stock market is linked to the arrival of new information (surprises) on macroeconomic fundamentals of both Mexico and the U.S.

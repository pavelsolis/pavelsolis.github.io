Welcome! 

I am a Senior Economist in the Financial Stability Division at [Banco de MÃ©xico](https://www.banxico.org.mx "Banxico"). My research focuses on the macroeconomic and financial effects of monetary policy in emerging markets. 

I am interested in applied macroeconomics, financial intermediation and international finance.
